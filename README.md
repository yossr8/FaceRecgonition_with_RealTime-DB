  <h1>📸 Real-Time Face Attendance System</h1>

  <p>This project demonstrates a <strong>real-time face recognition-based attendance system</strong> integrated with a cloud database. It is designed for <strong>accurate and efficient tracking of student attendance</strong> by leveraging advanced facial recognition techniques, real-time data updates, and an intuitive user interface.</p>

  <h2>🚀 Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>🎓 Real-Time Tracking:</strong> Automatically records student attendance using facial recognition, displaying ID and timestamp.</li>
    <li><strong>📊 Face Encoding:</strong> Utilizes 128-dimensional face encodings for precise identification.</li>
    <li><strong>☁️ Firebase Integration:</strong> Seamlessly stores and updates attendance records and student data in real time.</li>
    <li><strong>📐 User-Friendly Interface:</strong> Clean and responsive UI with real-time webcam feed overlays.</li>
    <li><strong>🔄 Duplicate Prevention:</strong> Prevents re-marking attendance within a configurable time window (e.g., 30 seconds).</li>
    <li><strong>📦 Secure Data Storage:</strong> Uses <code>pickle</code> to store face encodings and metadata.</li>
    <li><strong>🔧 Technical Setup Guidance:</strong> Step-by-step instructions for installing dependencies, compiling C++ code via Visual Studio, and configuring the system.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧠 Key Insights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Facial Recognition Efficiency:</strong> Enhances digital identity management across educational and professional environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Async Functionality:</strong> Ensures smooth performance in real-time applications through asynchronous operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Future-Proof Skills:</strong> Combines computer vision and web development — high-demand skills in the tech industry.</li>
    <li><strong>Hands-On Learning:</strong> Emphasizes practical, project-based learning with real-world applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Commercial Potential:</strong> Scalable for broader use cases such as corporate attendance, customer interaction, and object recognition.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>💡 Learn & Build</h2>
  <p>This project is part of a comprehensive course that teaches the necessary skills to build real-time computer vision systems with web integration. A <strong>Kickstarter campaign</strong> supports the course, encouraging community-driven learning and innovation.</p>
